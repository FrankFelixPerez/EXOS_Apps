## Description
The EXOS REST APIs are based on the YANG models from OpenConfig. The actual API follows RFC 8040 (RESTCONF).
The OpenConfig YANG models define a common set of data models created by industry network operators for managing networking equipement. Extreme XOS has adopted the RESTCONF approach going forward

## Example REST Client Applications
The examples directory contains sample Python applications that customers can use as a guide when implementing their own automation systems.
