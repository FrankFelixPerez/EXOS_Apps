# EXOS Optics XMOD Application
## User Documentation

This XMOD application is intended for use by Extreme customers to provide support for transceivers
on EXOS products without need to upgrade EXOS image.  Support for those transceivers will be added
via the Optics XMOD without having to wait for a future EXOS release.

This application works best when combined with Extreme Management Center. http://www.extremenetworks.com/product/management-center/

## Download
EXOS offers a variety of download methods. All of the methods below assume the EXOS switch has been configured with an IP address either on the `mgmt` VLAN (for the management port) or `default` VLAN (for the front panel ports).
### Download over tftp
To download onie-30.2.0.X-optics.xmod to an EXOS switch running ExtremeXOS 32.2 or later, place the file in a server tftp directory.

#### Download tftp over management port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download image _serverIP_onie-30.2.0.X-optics.xmod 

E.g.
`download image 10.10.10.1 onie-30.2.0.X-optics.xmod`

#### Download tftp over front panel port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download image _serverIP_ onie-30.2.0.X-optics.xmod vr VR-Default

E.g.
`download image 10.10.10.1 onie-30.2.0.X-optics.xmod vr VR-Default`

### Download over http
EXOS can download files from a web site using http. 
If your server does not have a web server and Python is installed, Python offers a simple HTTP web server. [Python Simple Web Server](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html)

Example starting a simple python web server on port 8000
```
cd <directory>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Copy onie-30.2.0.X-optics.xmod to _directory_ used in the example above.
#### Download http over management port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download url http://_serverIP_/onie-30.2.0.X-optics.xmod

E.g. `download url http://10.10.10.1/onie-30.2.0.X-optics.xmod`

#### Download http over front panel port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download url http://_serverIP_/onie-30.2.0.X-optics.xmod vr VR-Default

E.g. `download url http://10.10.10.1/onie-30.2.0.X-optics.xmod vr VR-Default`

### Download using EXOS web (Chalet)
- Using your browser, download summitX-ezvxlan-2.0.0.3.xmod from github to your PC. 
- Then using the EXOS web interface (Chalet), navigate to Apps->File Manager.
- Use: `Upload files from Local Drive:` to upload and install the file to the EXOS switch
