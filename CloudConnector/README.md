# EXOS CloudConnector Application
## _Attention: Install on ExtremeManagement Server only!_
This application enables ExtremeManagement to work with EXOS switches to provide a Zero Touch Provisioning Plus (ZTP+) exprience when installing 'just out of the box' ExtremeSwitches running EXOS.

__This firmware should be loaded to the ExtremeManagement 7.0.4 GA server via the Network->Firmware page. Do not load Cloud Connector directly to the switch.__ 
Let Extreme Management do that for you by marking it as the Reference Image on the Firmware page.
