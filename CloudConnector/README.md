# EXOS CloudConnector Application
## _Attention: Install on ExtremeManagement Server only!_
This application enables ExtremeManagement to work with EXOS switches to provide a Zero Touch Provisioning Plus (ZTP+) exprience when installing 'just out of the box' ExtremeSwitches running EXOS.

__This firmware should be loaded to the ExtremeManagement server via the Network->Firmware page. Do not load Cloud Connector directly to the switch.__ 
Let Extreme Management do that for you by marking it as the Reference Image on the Firmware page.
_See the list of CloudConnector versions to match the EXOS version running on your ExtremeSwitching hardware._

For a complete description of installation instructions and ExtremeManagement ZTP+ capabilities, see the ExtremeManagement 8.x documentation.

For Extreme Management Center 8.x, the firmware page is shown below:
