# EXOS CloudConnector Application

The EXOS CloudConnector application is used together with:
* ExtremeManagement 7.0.3 GA release
* EXOS 21.1.1.4-patch1-2, or later

The CloudConnector application provides Zero Touch Provisioning Plus (ZTP+) capabilities when used with ExtremeManagement 7.0.3 GA release. For a complete description, see the ExtremeManagement 7.0.3 documentation.

The CloudConnector application is installed on the ExtremeManagement server. It is not necessary to download this application directly to EXOS switches. ExtremeManagement will take care of that for you.
