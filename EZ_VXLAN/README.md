## Download
EXOS offers a variety of download methods. All of the methods below assume the EXOS switch has been configured with an IP address either on the `mgmt` VLAN (for the management port) or `default` VLAN (for the front panel ports).
### Download over tftp
To download summitX-ezvxlan-1.0.0.6.xmod to an EXOS switch running ExtremeXOS 21.1 or later, place the file in a server tftp directory.

#### Download tftp over management port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download image _serverIP_ summitX-ezvxlan-2.0.0.3.xmod

E.g.
`download image 10.10.10.1 summitX-ezvxlan-2.0.0.3.xmod`

### Download over http
EXOS can download files from a web site using http. 
If your server does not have a web server and Python is installed, Python offers a simple HTTP web server. [Python Simple Web Server](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html)

Example starting a simple python web server on port 8000
```
cd <directory>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Copy summitX-ezvxlan-2.0.0.3.xmod to _directory_ used in the example above.
#### Download http over management port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download url http://_serverIP_/summitX-ezvxlan-2.0.0.3.xmod

E.g. `download url http://10.10.10.1/summitX-ezvxlan-2.0.0.3.xmod`

#### Download http over front panel port
Enter the EXOS CLI command:
- download url http://_serverIP_/summitX-ezvxlan-2.0.0.3.xmod vr VR-Default

E.g. `download url http://10.10.10.1/summitX-ezvxlan-2.0.0.3.xmod vr VR-Default`

### Download using EXOS web (Chalet)
- Using your browser, download summitX-ezvxlan-2.0.0.3.xmod from github to your PC.
